WHAT IS SASS?

Sass is a pre-compiler for CSS.
Sass is also known as SCSS (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets).
Sass is not the only pre-compiler for CSS.  There are others!

WHY IS SASS?

Someone wanted to write functions for CSS.  Functions are not a part of CSS.
So someone came up with Sassy.

Also, it is reportedly "modular"; make CSS easier to read and organize.

HOW DOES SASS HELP?

One advantage of using Sass is that you can minimize the code that
has to be interpeted by the browser.
