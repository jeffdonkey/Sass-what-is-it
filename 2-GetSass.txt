You can use Sass/SCSS from a VSCode extension or from npm.

NPM INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. go to terminal of project
    2. import Sass: npm i -g sass
    3. in your project create a folder called: CSS
    4. type this command in terminal to create needed files within the folder CSS:
        sass scss/style.scss css/style.css
    5. this creates two files:
        style.css: the post-compiled css to be used by the application
        style.css.map: this links the css-like configurations from scss to css
